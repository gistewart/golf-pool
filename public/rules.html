                        Money Winnings” list, calculated at the end of “The Tour Championship”, and, this year, adjusted
                        to
                        include the winnings of the rescheduled US Open and The Masters held late in 2020, in each of
                        the
                        following six (6) categories: 1-10; 11-25; 26-50; 51-75; 76-100, and 100+. The sixth category
                        player
                        (100+) is anyone who the participant feels can be competitive. He neither has to possess a PGA
                        Tour
                        player’s card, nor does he have to have any other credentials. On Monday, November 16th. I shall
                        send all of you the official list of 2020 prize winnings for each of the categories 1, 2, 3, 4,
                        & 5.
                        As you all know, the 6th category is number 101+, and you can name anyone who does not fall into
                        the
                        first five categories. It is this list which must be used in your initial player lists, as well
                        as
                        any subsequent first and second half substitutions. This year there are no nonmember PGA Tour
                        players who would qualify as other than as a sixth category player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although it is probably unlikely that all participants will pick the same player for a
                        particular
                        category; if such does take place, I shall ask all participants for a replacement player in that
                        particular category. In this way, we shall avoid a meaningless category. In order to provide
                        adequate time for this unlikely event, the “Initial Player List” from each pool participant must
                        be
                        in the “Chief’s” hand no later than Midnight EST, Wednesday, December 16, 2020. This deadline
                        date
                        will also give the Chief the opportunity to review each participant’s initial player list to
                        make
                        certain that all players selected are in their proper categories.</p>

                        information is generally available approximately one-half hour after the end of the particular
                        tournament. In this manner, each participant will know his position vis-à-vis all the other
                        participants each week. The only monies to be included in these weekly calculations will be
                        those
                        won by players participating in that week’s sanctioned PGA Tour event(s). No monies won by any

                        will be calculated as was the case in our 2020 Pool, by applying a percentage against a total
                        purse
                        equal to the pen-ultimate event: “The BMW Championship”. A list of the percentages applied to
                        the 30
                        participants of “The Tour Championship” can be supplied to any participant who wishes to receive
