    "text": "The 2021 pool year covers that period constituted by those tournaments starting with “The Sentry Tournament of Champions” in Hawaii ( Jan. 7-10) and finishing with “The Tour Championship” (Sept 2-5).  No events, however official they may be, or sound, which take place after “The Tour Championship” will count.  The FedEx Cup points, as well as any cash payments based on them, or any handicaps based on FedEx points awarded to any players which are derived from some of the tournaments in our pool year, have no value for our pool."

    "section": "2. Player Selection",
    "text": "The Pool Participants (18 in number), shall choose one (1) player from the 2020 “PGA Tour Official Money Winnings” list, calculated at the end of “The Tour Championship”, and, this year, adjusted to include the winnings of the rescheduled US Open and The Masters held late in 2020, in each of the following six (6) categories:  1-10; 11-25; 26-50; 51-75; 76-100, and 100+.  The sixth category player (100+) is anyone who the participant feels can be competitive.  He neither has to possess a PGA Tour player’s card, nor does he have to have any other credentials.   On Monday, November 16th. I shall send all of you the official list of 2020 prize winnings for each of the categories 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.  As you all know, the 6th category is number 101+, and you can name anyone who does not fall into the first five categories.  It is this list which must be used in your initial player lists, as well as any subsequent first and second half substitutions.  This year there are no nonmember PGA Tour players who would qualify as other than as a sixth category player. \nAlthough it is probably unlikely that all participants will pick the same player for a particular category; if such does take place, I shall ask all participants for a replacement player in that particular category.  In this way, we shall avoid a meaningless category.  In order to provide adequate time for this unlikely event, the “Initial Player List” from each pool participant must be in the “Chief’s” hand no later than Midnight EST, Wednesday, December 16, 2020.  This deadline date will also give the Chief the opportunity to review each participant’s initial player list to make certain that all players selected are in their proper categories."

    "section": "3. Prize Money Calculations",
    "text": "The monies won by the players on each participant’s player list will be automatically calculated after each week’s tournament by our web app to which all of you can easily gain access.  This information is generally available approximately one-half hour after the end of the particular tournament.  In this manner, each participant will know his position vis-à-vis all the other participants each week.  The only monies to be included in these weekly calculations will be those won by players participating in that week’s sanctioned PGA Tour event(s).  No monies won by any participant’s players in a non-sanctioned event will be counted. \nIt should be noted here that the individual player’s prize money for the 2021 “Tour Championship” will be calculated as was the case in our 2020 Pool, by applying a percentage against a total purse equal to the pen-ultimate event: “The BMW Championship”.  A list of the percentages applied to the 30 participants of “The Tour Championship” is available replaceTextWithATag. "

    "section": "4. Substitutions",
    "text": "Each participant will have the right to make two (2) substitutions of players during the course of the pool year.  The first half substitution can be made from the start of the 2021 pool year until Midnight, April 28, 2021, immediately before the start of the “Valspar Championship”.\nThe second half substitution can be requested any time after the finish of the aforementioned “Valspar Championship” on May 2, 2021, up until Midnight, EDT, on September 1, 2021, immediately before the start of this year’s final event; “The Tour Championship”.\nNo substitution is mandatory; however, if any participant chooses not to make a first half substitution, he shall lose it, as there are no carryovers of the first half subs to the second half. These substitutions can be made in any of the six categories; however, the player being “Subbed In” must be from the same category (2020 Money List) as the player being “Subbed Out”."

    "section": "5. Buy-In",
    "text": "The individual “Buy-In” for the 2021 Pool remains at $450.00.  Those participants who won prize money in the 2020 pool will be advised that the $450 entry fee for this year’s pool will be retained from their prize payment.  These participants will not have any requirement to send in additional monies.  Those participants who do not have 2020 pool winnings to pay this fee should send your checks to D. V. Zander, by one of the methods described in the emailed document. All payments must be made by Tuesday, December 15, 2020. EST. "

    "section": "6. Prizes",
    "text": "With our group, this year remaining eighteen (18), and with the buy-in also remaining at $450, we shall have a total prize pool of $8,100.  As is the case each year, all of these funds will be paid out in prizes, either as prized for the first five places, AKA the podium positions, or for the Pool’s eight (8) “Mini-Pools”.\nThe first five places in the Pool at the end of “The Tour Championship” will collect as follows:  First Place: $1,650, Second Place: $1,050, Third Place: $750, Fourth Place: $600, and Fifth Place: $450.  Once again, in 2021, we shall have eight (8) “Mini-Pools”, one for each of the four “Majors”, and one each for “The Alan D. Schneider Collars Up Player’s Championship”, and for “The Tour Championship”.  In each of these events, the participant whose player list won the most money in that event will win the pool. We shall also have a mini-pool for the most successful first half substitution, and another for the most successful second half substitution.  Each mini-pool prize will be $450.\nShould anyone have any doubts or questions on these rules, please fire off your questions as quickly as possible."
