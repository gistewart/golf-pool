IMPORTANT
run liveTCHandicapSeed (via localhost...in browser) on day 1 of the TC when toPar and Today values are good to seed liveTCHandicaps db table. So, after all the players are on the course, but before the round does Final. Empty out the table in the db first as well.

This seeds the local db. For Prod db, delete prior year records in that table, and use Export wizard from local db, and Import wizard in Prod db.

Other changes:
seedLiveEventSchedule.js, line 56, purse amount
runTCHandicap.js, line 10, tournament id

index.html:
around line 57 uncomment, then comment out, message about Live Scoring


EDIT #1:
On seedScheduleStage.js
After the TC goes final, on the espn schedule page, the TC tournament does not appear as a Current Tournament and the following code on seedScheduleStage.js points to ALL of the Completed Tournaments
".mb5:nth-of-type(4) tbody tr"

But the TC does appear in the Completed Tournaments section.
Therefore, Sections 1 and 2 of code need to be commented out for the TC to be loaded properly.
OR manually record tournament on Schedules table in db and comment out schedule update code

EDIT #2:
On runResults.js
check purseSize amount (around line 149)

For next year's player categories:
/api/playerCategories
editing tournamentId range (start date? line 1670)
...then
/api/grabPlayerCategories
