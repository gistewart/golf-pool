IMPORTANT
run liveTCHandicapSeed (via localhost...in browser) on day 1 of the TC when toPar and Today values are good to seed TCHandicaps db table

EDIT #1:
On seedScheduleStage.js
After the TC goes final, on the espn schedule page, the TC tournament does not appear as a Current Tournament and the following code on seedScheduleStage.js points to ALL of the Completed Tournaments
".mb5:nth-of-type(4) tbody tr"

But the TC does appear in the Completed Tournaments section.
Therefore, the Sections 1 and 2 of code need to be commented out for the TC to be loaded properly.
OR manually record tournament on Schedules table in db and comment out schedule update code

EDIT #2:
On runResults.js
check purseSize amount (around line 131)
