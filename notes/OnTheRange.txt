Item 1:
For full Results data to be available at beginning of our season, the results for the off-season (i.e. all events after Tour Championship for the remainder of the calendar year) need to be loaded into ResultsAll. These are the steps.

Step 1: 
go to seedScheduleOther file; scrape should pull completed tournaments for current season (which is correct);
edit year dates on lines 33, 34 and 36;

Step 2:
in api-routes, run on localhost:8080 api/seedScheduleOther

Step 3: 
go to seedResultsAll file;
this file grabs the results for all the tournaments in the ScheduleOther table;
check to see if where clause needs edits

Step 4: 
in api-routes, run on localhost:8080 api/seedResultsAll
