Item 1:
For full Results data to be available at beginning of our season, the results for the off-season, including the Tour Championship need to be loaded into ResultsAll. These are the steps.

Step 1: 
go to seedScheduleOther.js script file; scrape should pull completed tournaments for current season (which is correct);
check date on if clause starting on line 42

Step 2: 
go to seedResultsAll file;
this file grabs the results for all the tournaments in the seedScheduleOther table;
check to see if where clause on line 13 needs edits
watch for loading of TC results

Step 3: 
this code will be run when the 'OnTheRange' tab is clicked
