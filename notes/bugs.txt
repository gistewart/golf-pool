1. change seedScheduleStage to account for Final being declared on days 1, 2 or 3 if this espn.com problem persists - DONE

2. Live Scoring didn't exit properly at the end of day 4 of the TC (maybe because tourney disappeared from Current section of espn seedScheduleStage) - WORKED FOR US OPEN

3. TC table does not render properly on some browsers - DONE

4. Show/hide TC table html link programatically

5. For U.S. Open, need a purse adjustment factor of 3.7% if only 60 pros make it to the weekend (pro-rated) - DONE

6. why is seedLiveEventSchedule.js run after when tournament has Final status?
