# golf-pool (app is under construction, so partial version of README at the moment)

## Project Description and Functionality

This is a full-stack Node.js app that provides a programmatic solution for a group of friends to track their progress, at a detailed level, in a golf pool. There are 18 participants (aka poolsters) in the pool and each participant's team comprises 6 non-exclusive picks: 1 golfer from each of 6 different tiers (the tiers are based on a golfer's earnings in the prior season). Selections are made in December each year, and the pool's 'season' typically includes all PGA Tour events from January through the end of the tour's season. Total team earnings are used to measure the success of each participant. The key functionality includes:

1. a participant can view the cumulative earnings for all teams in a leaderboard format, at a team and player level
2. a participant can view the earnings for the most recently completed tournament at a team and player level
3. a participant can view the earnings at a team and player level for all completed tournaments in the season to date

## Project Challenges

The main challenges of this project, and the solutions used, were as follows:

## Project Usefulness

There are X main areas of note:

1. It uses an Axios, Cheerio, MySQL and Sequelize to create a number of tables table in the database for the required functionality
2. It uses Express.js, the most widely used Node.js server framework, to build a server on the back end
