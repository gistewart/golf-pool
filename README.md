# golf-pool

## Project Description and Functionality

This is a full-stack Node.js app that provides a programmatic solution for a group of friends to track their progress, at a detailed level, in a fantasy golf league. There are 18 participants (aka poolsters) in the league and each participant's team comprises 6 non-exclusive picks: 1 golfer from each of 6 different tiers (the tiers are based on a golfer's earnings in the prior season). Selections are made in December each year, and the pool's 'season' typically includes all PGA Tour events from January through the end of the tour's season in September. Total earnings across the participants' selections is the measure of success used. The key functionality includes:

1. a participant can view the season-to-date earnings in a leaderboard format, at a team and player level
2. a participant can view the most recently completed tournament's earnings in a leaderboard format, at a team and player level
3. a participant can view the predicted earnings for an ongoing tournament using live scoring data, and the impact of such earnings on the overall standings, in a leaderboard format, at a team and player level
4. a participant can view the relative contribution of each of their player selections using a rating system
5. a participant can read / write comments to a message board

## Project Usefulness

It replaces an entirely manual process (taking hours to complete each week with poor data accuracy, with results reported in a user-unfriendly format), with a fully automated solution providing results data as soon at it is published.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node, Express, Axios, Cheerio, MySQL, Sequelize, Moment, Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize, Font Awesome

## Project maintenance and contributions

This is an app developed by Graeme Stewart that builds on work performed as part of Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp (Oct 2019 to Jan 2020).
